This was a JavaScript project, a simple game of tic-tac-toe I threw together over the course of a couple of days in order to become more comfortable with the fundamentals of the language.

The main purpose of this project was to re-familiarize myself with the syntax of JavaScript, while getting some practice using the factory and module patterns.
